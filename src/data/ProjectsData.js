        "A full-stack trading platform providing a secure and user friendly environment for trading ingame skins in the CS:GO market, estimated over 1 billion euros.",
      detailedDescription: `
      
          📈 Market Comparison: Similar platforms like SkinBaron and DMarket have shown the potential of digital asset trading platforms, each generating revenues of $10 million and upwards. CSFairTrade is aimed at capturing a share of this market by offering an enhanced user experience.
  
          🛠️ Technology Stack: CSFairTrade utilizes a modern web tech stack with React.js for an interactive frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MySQL for data management in an MVC architecture. I've also integrated Socket.IO for real time bidirectional communication between users and bots, complemented with HTTPS requests for data display and manipulation. Sequelize for ORM

          💼 User Authentication: I've integrated the Steam API's OAuth 2.0 for a smooth user registration process. Upon signing in via Steam, user data is stored in a session and saved to the database, ensuring a smooth user experience.

          🎮 Platform: CSFairTrade provides an interface that enables users to directly manage their inventories. It retrieves user inventory data, aggregates data from all bots, and accesses the current price list. Despite the limitations of Steam's API requests, I've developed a solution that stores and displays data using MySQL. Currently, this database is hosted on Azure. The platform's design is an event-driven and REST API architecture.
          🧪 Testing and Coverage: The project has undergone testing using React Testing Library and Jest. The current focus is on refactoring and writing proper tests for each component. The project has achieved a test coverage of 45% for statements and 48% for lines. The coverage report provides insights into which files and lines are not covered by the tests, helping in identifying areas that require additional testing. Please take into consideration that I'm still a junior and I am working on increasing the test coverage. 

          🚀 Deployment: CSFairTrade is deployed on DigitalOcean droplets using PM2, with unique IPs allocated for both frontend and backend. We manage the CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions. All traffic is SSL-secured and directed via Nginx. Both unit- and functional tests are in place for stability. Firewalls has also been implemented to enhance security. 

          🏆CSFairTrade represents a personal achievement for me, involving numerous hours of learning and understanding various technologies outside of my formal education. The project required me to tackle challenges including working with APIs, implementing a user authentication process, integrating payment gateways, business logic and even setting up a fully functional CI/CD pipeline.

        "Developed an Event-driven queue system for students and supervisors with Zeromq, Springboot and Python",
      detailedDescription: `
    
      🤝 Collaboration: I teamed up with another student to develop a Distributed Queue System for students supervisor in the course "Distributed system". Both of us focused on creating a structured workflow, implementing server and client side functionalities, and maintaining project documentation.

      🛠️ Tech Stack: The project using technologies such as Java 17, Python 3.12, Maven, Spring Boot, ZeroMQ, and Tkinter, showcasing a blend of technologies with a good user design desktop interface.

      📚 Features & Reflection: The Distributed Queue System is built with an event-driven architecture, featuring a Pub/Sub and Request/Respond pattern through ZeroMQ sockets. It incorporates mechanisms like heartbeats for maintaining client presence in the queue and used in communication between students, supervisors, and the server. The system can even connect with external API if wished by user.

      🚀 Growth: The experience of developing this project showcases the workflows, code reviews, and a well organized codebase. I have learned the how to build properly event-driven architecture and balancing between different technologies. This is my second event-driven project, first one was with Socket.IO with NodeJS (CSFairTrade). CSfairtrade event driven strucutre  was a bit more complicated which included communication between external API (having accounts as bots in Steam API) communicating with users, such as trading etc. But it was fun seeing the difference of implementation of these two different sockets in different langauges. Looking forward, I want to implement more advanced concepts and tools, like implementing CI/CD pipelines and evaluating another libraries for GUI development (such as PySide).

      📘 Documentation & Architecture: The documentation provides a readme file that consist overview of the project, covering aspects from installation to API endpoints. The system adopts an event-driven architecture, with detailed explanations of the components, such as Event Object, Event Listener, Service Folder, Config Files, and Workers.

        "A desktop version of the Blackjack card game, developed in collaboration with a classmate. It was a challenging yet exciting process to transform the game rules into logic and implementing it in Java.",
      detailedDescription: `

        🎲 Game Basics: The game blackjack requires the player and dealer to have two cards each. One of the dealer's cards remains concealed from the player. Players have options to either stand or hit, which are displayed as buttons. The game's primary goal is to ensure the player's score does not exceed 21.

        📜 Game Rules: If the player's score is above 21, they lose. Otherwise, when the player stands, it's the dealer's turn to hit. The dealer continues hitting until they reach a score of 17 or more. Once the dealer's turn is over and their score is under 21, both player and dealer scores are compared. Depending on the comparison, the player can either win, lose, or tie. Players also have an option to place bets, but they can't bet beyond their current balance.

        🛠️ MVC Design: The design follows the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern, ensuring clear code structure. The model manages data, the view is responsible for displaying the game, and the controller handles the game logic.

        🌐 Design Choice: The MVC pattern was chosen because of its robustness in maintaining a clean separation between the frontend and backend. One alternative was to let the graphical user interface handle both game logic and display, but this would complicate code management.
